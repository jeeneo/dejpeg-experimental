experimental models for DeJPEG (requires enabling experimental mode)

soon DeJPEG will support "experimental mode" which disables model safety checks (filename/hashing) and allows importing experimental models

models planned are:

https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-DitherDeleterV3-Smooth (unconverted)

https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-Bandage-Smooth (unconverted)

----

if you would like to request a model, you can look at [OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/?t=scale%3A1)'s list for `1x` models (any 2x or up models not planned), then file an issue and I'll look into seeing if it can be added

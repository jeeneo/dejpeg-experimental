https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-Bandage-Smooth

https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-DeEdge

https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-UnResizeOnly-RCAN

https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-GainRESV4

----

if you would like to request a model, you can look at [OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/?t=scale%3A1)'s list for `1x` models

2x, 4x, etc, ("upscaling" models) wont be officially supported by DeJPEG (at it's current stage) as there exists plenty of "super res AI enhancers" available and it requires more processing power and consumption for what it's worth, i'd recommend a desktop anyway, since GPUs are better at that than phones. Nevertheless you can always fork the app and add your own functionality, since this is just a UI for the ONNX runtime.

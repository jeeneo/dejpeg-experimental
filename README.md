experimental models for DeJPEG (requires enabling experimental mode)

(mainly for converting GIF animations to APNG while removing the GIF artifacts because the existing models only fair 'okay' with GIFs)

soon DeJPEG will support "experimental mode" which disables model safety checks (filename/hashing) and allows importing experimental models

models planned are:

https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-DitherDeleterV3-Smooth

https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-Bandage-Smooth

https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-DeEdge

https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-UnResizeOnly-RCAN

https://openmodeldb.info/models/1x-GainRESV4

----

if you would like to request a model, you can look at [OpenModelDB](https://openmodeldb.info/?t=scale%3A1)'s list for `1x` models (please do not request any 2x or up models), then file an issue and I'll look into seeing if it can be added
